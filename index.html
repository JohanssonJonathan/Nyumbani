      				<h3>How we manufacture our boards</h3>
      				<p>Our id√©a is to make new minicruisers from old used
      				Skateboards. Skaters use their boards a certain amount of time. When they don't have
      				any use of them anymore we take care of it and reuse them.
      				The board goes through a certain amount of steps before we deliver it to the
      				new customer.
